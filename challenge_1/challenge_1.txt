Challenge 1.1: Parse the list of users
Basic challenge
In the data folder, you can find a file called users.json. This file includes (fake) data about 10 people.

Create a Python program that would read the contents of this file and do the following:

Separate/split the name into first_name and last_name
For each person print out the following things (in this order):
Last name
First name
Latitude of the city the person lives in (geo/lat)
The catch phrase of the company that this person works for
Bonus challenge
Create a program that will ask the user to enter some last name (for example "Graham").
If a person with this last name is in users.json, then print that person's name, email and company name.
