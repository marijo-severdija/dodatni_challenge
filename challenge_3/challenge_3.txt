Challenge 1.3: Blackjack
Have you ever played Blackjack? If not, try it out, there are plenty of online games out there.
The rules are very simple. :)

Write a Blackjack Python script where you can play against the computer.

Bonus: Set two levels for computer, aggressive and conservative.

One option is that the player chooses the level for the computer before the game starts.

Another option is that the level is set automatically, either before the game or even during the game
(the computer could randomly switch from being aggressive to being conservative).
