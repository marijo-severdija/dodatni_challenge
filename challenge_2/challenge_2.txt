Challenge 1.2: Parse the weather data
Go to the data folder and download the weather.json file.

Create a computer program that would read this file and print out the following:

City name
Country code
Current temperature
Weather description
Bonus challenge:

Find values for sunrise and sunset.
This is a timestamp for at which time the sun goes up and at which time goes down (for that specific day).

Convert the timestamps into an actual date and time (day, month, year, hour, minutes).

Hint: you will need to use the datetime library for this.
